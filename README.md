Tomato Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithm
Agriculture is the life of our nation. Due to this crops protection from various diseases is needed. We took tomato as a sample crop for research.
To Extract the features from the images we used the Color and texture features which are extracted using color histogram and canny method respectively.
This article presents an approach for detection of tomato plant leaf disease using six ML algorithm which gave us accuracy between 65.70% to 95.04% .
